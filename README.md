# myND FOND Planner

This is a fork of the [original myND repository](https://github.com/robertmattmueller/myND). It is itself a fork of [haz's fork](https://github.com/haz/myND) to make it compatible with newer Java, and better documented here.

## Build it

myND requires Java 1.8 and Maven.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven
```

To build it:

```shell
$ JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

**Note:** Maven will not compile the system with Java 17.

The above will produce `target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Run it

To see all options available:

```shell
$ java -cp target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mynd.MyNDPlanner -h help
```

The planner can take SAS encodings or original PDDL domain and problem files. For example, to run over a SAS file with 4GB of heap size and output the solution to file `plan` (use `-exportPlan`):

```shell
$ java -Xmx4g -cp target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mynd.MyNDPlanner data/benchmarks-fond/blocksworld_p10.sas -exportPlan plan
Heuristic: FF-heuristic.
Algorithm: LAO*-search
INITIAL IS PROVEN!

Result: Strong cyclic plan found.

Time needed for preprocess (Parsing, PDBs, ...):    0.011 seconds.
Time needed for search:                             0.02 seconds.
Time needed:                                        0.031 seconds.
Total Garbage Collections: 1
Total Garbage Collection Time: 0 seconds.

Out of 58 nodes, 19 are proven
Number of node expansions: 19
Policy entries: 10
Number of sensing applications in policy: 0
Plan file: plan
```

The same example but now over the original PDDL input files and with some options fixed:

```shell
$ java -Xmx4g -cp target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mynd.MyNDPlanner \
    -type FOND -search LAOSTAR -heuristic FF  \
    data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/domain.pddl data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/p10.pddl
```

This will also print out the translator's output (from PDDL to SAS).

There is also a script `mynd.sh` to run the planner with default options:

```shell
$ ./mynd.sh data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/domain.pddl data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/p10.pddl
```




### Running from class files

Presumably, one can run the system from the Java class files directly (folder `bin` after build) as follows:

```shell
$ java <JavaOptions> mynd.MyNDPlanner <PlannerOptions> <SAS-file>
```

Useful Java Options are:

```shell
    * `-Xmx4g`: to set the maximum heap space to 4 GB
    * `-ea`: to enable assertions
```

However, it does not runn when there are planner options given:

```shell
$ cd bin
$ java -ea -Xmx4g mynd.MyNDPlanner -search LAOSTAR -heuristic FF ../data/benchmarks-fond/blocksworld_p1.sas
Option search unknown.
```
